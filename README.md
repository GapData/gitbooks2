# Fair and Explainable ML @ ODSC Europe

You can find all material for the workshops on fair and explainable AI here. Both workshops will be using a Jupyter notebook that you can either run on your own machine or in Watson Studio on the IBM Cloud. 

To go through the workshop material smoothly it will be easiest when we all use the same setup, especially as it will be harder to help you straight away when you might get stuck during this virtual event. Of course feel free to use your own local machine when you are comfortable with environments and installing missing packages.

{% hint style="warning" %}
I will try to help you when you have issues with the setup, but as time is limited during the workshop it is possible I have to do this later through the ODSC slack channels. I will be there for the full conference.
